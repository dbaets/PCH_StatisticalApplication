# Proefcentrum Hoogstraten - Statistical application
This web applicaton (written in R- Shiny) is designed to perform alle frequently used statistical tests in one place. In this way the Research Centre Hoogstraten (Proefcentrum Hoogstraten vzw, PCH) can report their findings on experimental trials in a repeatable, uniform way across the whole company.
At the moment following tests can be performed using this shiny application:

* Student-T-test
* Anova
* Mann-Whithney
* Kruskalwallis

For each statistical test all conditions required for that test are checked in order to select the right test. 

In the following months following tests may be added to the application:

* Scoring data (non parametric)
* Repeated measures anova
* Linear regression
* GLM models

If you have any suggestions or questions about the application please don't hesitate to contact me *dieterbaets(at)gmail(dot)com*
